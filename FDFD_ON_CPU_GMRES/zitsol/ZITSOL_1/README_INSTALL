|--------------- Complex Iterative Solvers Package --------------------|
+======================================================================+

This is  part of  the ITSOL extention  to the SPARSKIT  package.  This
particular  sub-package provides  preconditioners for  solving general
sparse * complex-valued * linear systems of equations.

Once you  have unpacked the tar  ball -- go to  the ZITSOL_1 directory
and edit  the file 'makefile' for customizing  the loaders, compilers,
compiler flags, etc ... then type

make lib

to create the library libzitsol.a

Once this is  done you can try some of the  test examples in TESTS_COO
or TESTS_HB. You can for example go to TESTS_COO and type

 make all

 which will make the executables :
	        zarms.ex, zilut.ex, ziluc.ex (**removed), and ziluk.ex

 then you can execute the script 
 
 runall to run all these drivers with the two sample matrices provided
 in ./SAMPLE_MATRICES [two for each of TESTS_COO and TESTS_HB] 

The makefile in  TESTS_* will require that the user  edit the links to
blas and lapack in the LINKS directive.

To test a single  preconditioner, for example the arms preconditioner,
type for matrices stored in coo format type:

make zarms.ex 

This should create an executable called arms.ex 

Typing zarms.ex should run this  for the sample matrices in coordinate
format located in SAMPLE_MATRICES and  for the input parameters in the
file inputs.  [two sample matrices  are provided in  coordinate format
and two in the hb format]
